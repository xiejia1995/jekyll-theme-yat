## About


:art:&nbsp;XIE JIa is a PHD student at Heidelberg University in Germany. 


From 2018 on, I have been a member of the project [Early Chinese Periodicals Online (ECPO)](https://uni-heidelberg.de/ecpo). 
The most interesting work was editing the Ground Truth of Republican Chinese Newspapers. An introduction of this task can be found [here (video recording in German)](https://zo-pandora.zo.uni-heidelberg.de/BJQ/player#embed) and [here (abstract)](https://konfuzius-institut-heidelberg.de/event/online-vortrag-early-chinese-periodicals-online-ecpo-ein-projekt-stellt-sich-vor/). 

I am the founder of the [HEADs](https://dhhd2022.github.io), which is an academic platform to inform the Chinese readers of the DH news and resources in the "Western" academia. We are also running a Wechat account "东亚数字人文".
